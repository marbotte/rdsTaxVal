Description: In order to check and correct taxonomy, `rdsTaxVal` defines an S3
    extension for taxonomy data.frames based on the rds format used in 
    Instituto Humboldt (research institute for Colombian Biodiversity) for
    permanent plots. Them, there are functions which use the new attributes of 
    the object (mostly the names of variables of the table which corresponds
    to regular elements of a taxonomic table).
